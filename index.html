 This is a project I'm hoping to undertake next semester.

<section class="instructions">
 <h2>Instructions</h2>
 <ol>
 <li>Cutting the body</li>
 	<ul> <li>Make sure you plan your design well. Measure twice, cut once.</li>
 		<li>Route cavities for pickups, knobs, and quarter-inch jack.</li> <li>Design for comfort - consider adding a cutaway or arm contour.</li></ul>
<li>Cutting the neck</li>
	<ul><li>There are a few elements to consider here: the neck itself, the truss rod, the headstock, and the fretboard.</li>
		<li>You want to prepare each element individually, and assemble at the end.</li>
		<li>For the headstock, you can use excess wood from the neck blank to slant the headstock downward.</li>
		<li>Drill a cavity through the neck, and insert the truss rod through this cavity.</li>
		<li>Attach the fretboard using wood glue, then slot fret positions and install the frets.</li>
		<li>Attach the finished neck to the body using screws or wood glue.</li></ul>
<li>Installing hardware</li>
	<ul><li>Install pickups, tuners, nut, and bridge into the cavities you drilled earlier.</li></ul>
<li>Wiring the electronics</li>
	<ul> <li>Install the electrical components in their respective cavities.</li>
		<li>Route wires through the cavities you drilled earlier, and solder them to their corresponding components.</li></ul>
<li>Set up and play!</li>
	<ul><li>Congratulations! You're now ready to string your guitar and shred to your heart's content. Make sure you tune your strings, and adjust the truss rod and action as necessary.</li></ul>
